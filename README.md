# Sentiment Analyzer Application

Now a days Business's are more focusing on users behaviours. One of the best way to understand your product is to check users reviews and their ratings.  
There are times when a user writes Good, Nice App or any other positive text, in the review and gives 1-star rating. Your goal is to identify the reviews where the semantics of review text does not match rating. 
### Solution:- 
- I have created an application that will identify such ratings where review text is good, but rating is negative- so that the support team can point this to users.
